    "In this first lab, to get familiar with RNNs, we will explore the simple problem of teaching an RNN to add binary strings. Recall, like grade-school addition, binary addition moves from the right-most bit (least-significant bit or LSB) towards the left-most bit (most-significant) bit, with a carry bit passed from the previous addition.\n",

    "For example:\n",
    "If the bit strings 010 (integer value = 2) and 011 (integer value = 3) are to be added to produce the sum 101 (integer value 5), the following is the sequence of inputs and targets to the RNN when training:\n",

In the lectures we saw using training RNNs to predict output probabilities for each category (=2 in our case, one for 0, and one for 1), and using softmax followed by cross-entropy as the loss function:\n",
    "\n",
    "Still, use affine (or linear) projection from hidden-state to output, but now regress to two \"scores\" (what should be dimensionality of `W_{hy}`?):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$s_t = W_{hy}h_t + b_{hy}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This output now should converted to \"probabilities\" using `softmax`, and then errors should be back-propagated using the cross-entropy loss function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y_t^i = \\frac{\\exp(s_t^i)}{\\sum_{j=1}^{j=2} \\exp(s_t^j)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note the \"2\" in the above equation is for 2 scores -- corresponding to 0 and 1 respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cross-entropy loss is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathcal{L}_t(y_t,\\tilde{y_t}) = - (1-\\tilde{y_t})\\log(y_t^1) - \\tilde{y_t}\\log(y_t^2) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where, $y_t$ are the predicted log-probabilties (or score above) and $\\tilde{y_t}$ is the ground-truth target (i.e., either 0 or 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "__Note__ : Make sure you understand how this equation corresponds to what you saw in the lecture.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You might notice that the steps --- `softmax` followed by `cross-entropy` loss, first exponentiate and then take the log of the score. This is numerically unstable due to under/overflow (in the exponentiation). As this is a widely used operation, `PyTorch` combines these two steps in their [`nn.CrossEntropyLoss`](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/nn.html#crossentropyloss) function. So if we use this function, we do not have to explicitly use `softmax`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "__Part A__\n",
    "1. Modify the model to predict two output probabilities -- for 0 and 1 respectively at each time-step.\n",
    "2. Change the loss function from `nn.MSELoss` to `nn.CrossEntropyLoss`. Refer to the documentation of `nn.CrossEntropy` [here](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/nn.html#crossentropyloss).\n",
    "3. Modify the \"testing\" code to get output from the model and verify that you are getting sensible outputs. \n",
    "\n",
    "__Part B__\n",
    "1. In Q1 above, with the MSE loss, what was the minimum length of training bit-strings required to achieve perfect generalization?\n",
    "2. What is the minimum length of training bit-strings required to achieve perferct generalization on longer test bit-string, when using the new model trained using the CrossEntropy loss function? Explain why / why not it is different.\n",
    "\n",
    "Phew! That required some serious digging into PyTorch. But we are only getting started, marching on...\n"
